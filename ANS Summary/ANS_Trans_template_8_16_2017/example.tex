\section{Introduction (Heading A)}
Microsoft Word can be a finicky beastie. \LaTeX\ abstracts content from
formatting, allowing the user to let a style file such as this take care of
uppercasing the section headings, spacing the paragraphs, and shuffle around
the figures.

The \SN\ equations were developed by Carlson \cite{Car1953}. Another

Equations look exceedingly pretty. Here is a 3-D, monoenergetic, steady-state
transport equation with isotropic scattering and an isotropic extraneous source:
\begin{subequations} \label{eqs:fullTransport}
\begin{multline} \label{eq:fullTransportVol}
  \vec{\Omega}\vd \grad \psi(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega})
  + \sigma(\vec{x}) \psi (\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega})
\\ =
  \frac{\sigma_s(\vec{x})}{4\pi} \int_{4\pi} \psi(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega}')
  \ud\Omega' + \frac{q(\vec{x})}{4\pi}
  \equiv \frac{1}{4\pi} Q(\vec{x}) \,,
\end{multline}
inside $\vec{x} \in V$, $\vec{\Omega} \in 4\pi$, with an incident boundary
condition
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fullTransportBndy}
  \psi(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}) = \psi^b(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}) \,,
 \quad \vec{x} \in \partial V, \ \vec{\Omega} \vd \vec{n} < 0\,.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

\section{Results and Analysis (Heading A)}
The results were interesting, so interesting in fact that we have decided to
present them here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Subsection Goes Here (Heading B)}
The user must manually capitalize initial letters of a subsection heading.

For those who like equations in their papers, \LaTeX\ is a good choice. Here is
an equation for the Marshak diffusion boundary condition:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:marshak}
  4 J^- = \phi + 2 D \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation}
If we so choose, we can effortlessly reference the equation later.

Another paragraph starts with Eq.~\eqref{eq:marshak} and sets $J^-$ to zero, a
vacuum boundary condition:
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \phi + \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{\sigma} \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation*}
The extrapolation distance is $2/3$. A more detailed asymptotic analysis yields
an extrapolation distance of about $0.71045$.

Figure~\ref{fig:voltage} shows how a plot might conceivably look in your
document. Always place figures after they are referenced so as not to throw
off the reader. You can use symbols and different line styles to help
differentiate your results, especially if they are printed in black and white.
Note how Fig.~\ref{fig:voltage} uses dashed lines \verb|--| for the exact
solution, solid lines \verb|-| for the new method's solutions, and dotted lines
\verb|:| for existing inaccurate methods.

\section{Conclusions (Heading A)}
The included ANS style file and this clear example file are a panacea for
the hours of headache that invariably results from formatting a document in
Microsoft Word.

\section{Appendix}

Numbering in the appendix is different:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix}
  2 + 2 = 5\,.
\end{equation}
and another equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix2}
  a + b = c\,.
\end{equation}
